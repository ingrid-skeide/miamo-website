## A Baby Blog

This is the exam project at the end of the first year of my studies at Noroff. The task was to create a blog to showcase what I've learned over this year. I chose to create a baby blog because I had a baby last year, and that naturally creates a lot of inspiration in everything in my daily life.

## Description

The project contains the following pages:

- Home page with menu, header, introduction, gallery and latest post carousel.
- About page with a little more info about who we are and my motivation for creating this blog.
- Contact page with a simple form with form validation.
- List of blog posts dynamically built using REST API.
- Blog specific page for each blog post built using query string parameter. Contains more text and an image modal for the feature image. 

## What I learned

This project really challenged me with the javascript. I needed to create a carousel which featured latest posts, in addition to a pop up modal when feature image is clicked. I gained a better understanding for javascript and find it easier to write simple functions and have a correct use of methods. I still have a lot to learn, the sort function is not working well as it doesn't sort all the posts, but it will be fun to improve the site later. I have plans to add a 'One line a day' page, comment field for the blog specific pages, and a filter to start with. As the page grows and I learn more, I will add to it.
